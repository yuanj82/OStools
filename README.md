## Description

A Python exercise project for beginners.A simple rice ID conversion and sequence extraction tool.

## Usage

If it is used for rice, simply [download](https://jihulab.com/YuanJ2003/id-converter/-/archive/main/id-converter-main.zip) the secondary repository and run `main.py` or `main.exe`.

If it is used for other species, you need to prepare the ID correspondence and genome protein sequence, and modify the method of modifying ID in lines `33-36` of `main.py`, import new files, and code related to other ID representations.

## Data sources

- [RAP-DB](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/)
- [Ensembl](https://plants.ensembl.org/index.html)

## TODO

- Implement an interface oriented program.
- Integrate data and programs as a whole, while preserving other interfaces for importing data.
